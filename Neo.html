<p>Neo was born as one of the billions of bluepills connected to the Matrix where he was known as Thomas A. Anderson. As Thomas Anderson, he was a "normal citizen with a social security number" who held a day job as a computer programmer for the MetaCortex software company. However, outside of this persona, he worked as a hacker selling contraband programming under the alias, Neo, which he later adopts as his common-use name once he got freed from the Matrix.</p>
<p>One night, while waiting for a client to pick up contraband software, Neo was conducting an extensive online and periodical search for mentions of "Morpheus". The search gets interrupted and, blacking out his screen, a message read: "The Matrix has you..." then replaced by "Follow the white rabbit."</p>
<p>Neo tried to restore his computer to normal before a final message displayed and read: "Knock, knock, Neo". A banging is promptly heard from Neo's door as his client, Choi, accompanied by his girlfriend, Dujour, come searching for Neo</p>
<p>Neo transacted with them, taking two discs containing some unrevealed programming from his secret stash, a hollowed-out copy of Simulacra and Simulation. Noticing how Neo was looking pale, Choi invited Neo along for a night of partying at a nearby club. Neo refused initiallyâ€”until he spotted a white rabbit tattooed on Dujour's arm. Remembering the message on his computer, Neo decided to tag along.</p>
<p>At the club, Neo met the mysterious message sender, who introduced herself as Trinity. Neo recognized the name as that belonging to a famous hacker that cracked the IRS D-base. Surprised that the infamous wizard-class hacker was a woman, Trinity confirmed how most guys tended to share the misconception. She also confirmed his suspicions about the world, alluding to the Matrix, hinting to more clues and adding confusion to his search for the truth.</p> 
<p>Neo awoke the next day already late for work. He then received a reprimand from his boss, Mr. Rhineheart, for his frequent tardiness and was further threatened from losing his job should he ever be late again. Back in his cubicle, a FedEx employee delivers to him a package containing a cellular phone. It immediately rings, revealing Morpheus to be at the other end of the line Neo answered. Without much formal introduction, Morpheus warned Neo that the authorities were quickly coming to arrest him, and offered his help to get Neo out of the building</p>
<p>Neo followed his advice and made it out of the building without being seen. However, as he was about ten stories off of the ground, he refused to navigate a path which took him outside office walls. Fearing for his life, Neo instead turned his self in.</p>
<p>The Agents that interrogated Neo was led by Agent Smith, who offered to expunge Neo's lengthy list of criminal charges in exchange for information on the whereabouts of Morpheus. Neo refused and demanded his phone call per the usual rights of the accused. Agent Smith replied, "Tell me, Mr. Anderson... what good is a phone call... if you're unable to speak?" before proceeding to do something to alter Neo's physical body. Neo's mouth began to seal shut, blocking his screams of shock, outrage, and pain as the Agents proceeded to drop a bug unto his body. The bug burrowed straight down into his navel, depicting a quite uncomfortable scene</p>
