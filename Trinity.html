<p>Like the series' other principal characters, Trinity is a computer programmer and a hacker who has escaped from the Matrix, a sophisticated computer program in which most of the human race is imprisoned as virtual slaves. Though few specifics are revealed about her previous life inside the Matrix, it is revealed that Morpheus, one of a number of real-world hovercraft commanders, initially identified her and helped her escape from the program.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the series, she is the first mate on Morpheus' Nebuchadnezzar and serves mainly as a go-between for him and the individuals he wishes to free from the Matrix. As the series progresses, her primary importance as a character becomes her close relationship with Neo. She is skilled with computers, at operating vehicles both inside and outside the Matrix, and in martial arts.</p>
<p>Throughout the series, her original name (prior to being freed from the Matrix) is never revealed. In The Matrix Resurrections, she is given the name "Tiffany", which she hates, and goes by the nickname "Tiff".</p>
